1.0.4 2020-04-24
  - Upgrade Scalatra 2.7.0
  - Update xsbt-web-plugin
    from 4.0.2 to 4.2.0

1.0.3 2018-06-30
  - Deleted JRebelPlugin
    Because myJRebel will stop on July 5, 2018 and
    can not maintain the JRebelPlugin without purchasing a license.

1.0.2 2018-03-08
  - Update xsbt-web-plugin
    from 4.0.1 to 4.0.2

1.0.1 2017-10-15
  - Update xsbt-web-plugin
    from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1

1.0.0 2017-09-17
  - AutoPlugin compatible
  - sbt 1.x compatible
  - Removed WarOverlay Plugin
    Because it seems that it is better to separate it from sbt-scalatra
    from an aspect of maintainability, rather than a function unique to
    Scalatra, and make it an independent plugin.
